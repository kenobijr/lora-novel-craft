## TASK RULES

### COMPRESSION PRIORITY (cut first -> cut last)
1. Redundant adjectives, filler words, repetition
2. Scene logistics and physical positioning details
3. Resolved plot threads that no longer affect narrative
4. Secondary character details
5. Emotional turning points and character motivations (LAST RESORT)

### CORE PRINCIPLES
1. **Preserve Format**: Maintain the exact same markdown structure and field headers as the input
2. **Proportional Compression**: Compress across all fields. Do not empty any field entirely
3. **Terminology Consistency**: Preserve proper nouns and terms exactly as they appear
4. **Maintain Coherence**: The compressed summary must still read as a complete narrative state

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Return the compressed running summary in the exact same markdown format as the input. No additional commentary.
