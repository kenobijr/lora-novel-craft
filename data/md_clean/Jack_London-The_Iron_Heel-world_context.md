# World Context

## TONE & STYLE
- Era/Genre: Early 20th-century Alt-History / Dystopian Socialist Realism.
- Atmosphere: Oppressive, Militant, Clinical.
- Prose Voice: A scholarly, retrospective memoir (Avis Everhard) punctuated by cold, analytical footnotes from a distant, enlightened future (Anthony Meredith).
- Sensory Anchors: The "put-a-put" of machine guns; the scent of redwoods at Wake Robin Lodge; the "scarlet livery" of the Oligarchy; the roar of the "Abysmal Beast" (the mob).

## WORLD RULES / CORE REALITY
- Tech/Magic Level: Industrial-age technology; wireless stations, armored "war-automobiles," and primitive hot-air balloons used as tactical bombers.
- Social Order: The Plutocracy (Seven Groups) at the apex; the favored Labor Castes (privileged unions) and Mercenaries as enforcers; the "People of the Abyss" (impoverished unorganized labor) at the bottom.
- Key Constraint: Power is the only arbiter; the Oligarchy maintains control through "the Iron Heel," crushing dissent with economic expropriation and military slaughter.
- Narrative Structure: A "Frame Narrative." The main text is presented as a "found manuscript" annotated by a historian 700 years in the future.
- Dual Timeframes:
  1. The "Present" (Action): The 1912-1932 Revolt.
  2. The "Future" (Frame): The 27th Century Socialist Utopia (419 B.O.M.).

## PROTAGONIST CONDITIONS
- Avis Everhard, a convert from the sheltered university class, operates as an undercover agent-provocateur. 
- Her survival depends on total identity transformation as she supports her husband Ernest, the "Eagle," in orchestrating a global socialist revolution against the rising Plutocracy.

## FACTIONS
- Ruling Power: The Oligarchy; goals are total capitalistic consolidation and the creation of "Wonder Cities" (Ardis/Asgard); marked by the scarlet livery and high-culture aesthetic.
- Resistance: The Socialists/Fighting Groups; goals are the Cooperative Commonwealth and the overthrow of the Iron Heel; marked by red banners and secret hand signals.
- Third Force: The Mercenaries; professional hereditary soldiers who act as the balance of power between castes.

## LOCATIONS
- The Abyss (Chicago/Slums): Festering, squalid labor-ghettos characterized by "nightmare" violence and "human lava" mobs.
- The Refuge (Sonoma/Wake Robin): Secret, idyllic wilderness hideouts used for training, clandestine meetings, and domestic respite.
- The Outside: A fractured world-market where Germany, Japan, and the United States clash until unified by Oligarchic alliances.

## NARRATIVE ENGINE
- Central Conflict: The inevitable, centuries-long struggle between the consolidated Plutocracy and the international socialist revolution.
- Stakes: If the revolution fails, humanity is doomed to three hundred years of brutal, caste-based slavery under a relentless despotism.
- Thematic Core: Can a peaceful democratic transition survive the violent "logic of the club," or must social evolution be written in blood?
